# Repository Structure 

# Project overview 
This project focuses on analyzing player behavior and monetization data using SQL. The objective is to create and manage a relational database schema and perform complex queries to derive actionable insights for optimizing player engagement and monetization strategies in online gaming.


# Dataset 
Im using a kaggle dataset named ðŸŽ® Predict Online Gaming Behavior Dataset by
[ -d rabieelkharoua/predict-online-gaming-behavior-dataset
](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/predict-online-gaming-behavior-dataset?resource=download)


 ### Prerequisties 
 - SQL Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- SQL client or tool (e.g., pgAdmin, MySQL Workbench)


## Data cleaning (cleaning dataset is the most important part of the job)
* First I've downloaded raw data from kaggle and opened using Excel to clean data.
* Made sure Date and other numericals are right format before  loading onto SQL client.
* Check for null values, either delete them or fill them based on importance of the column.
* check for duplicate rows, delete duplicate rows make it easier to work on data and vizualization for further analysis.

## Data loading 
* We are going to import data into postgreSQL the data import query is like this and make sure to use only small letters.

* This will succesfully import our dataset into our database and we start querying.
